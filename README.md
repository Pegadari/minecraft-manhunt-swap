# minecraft-manhunt-swap
Based on the AdvancedManhunt Skript plugin for Minecraft, but when a hunter kills the runner, they swap roles. Also includes a few extra goodies!

I haven't done anything here yet, but I will soon. Here is the link to the original project that this is a modification of:

This project was the idea of a few friends of mine. They asked me to make the plugin and I thought I'd share it.
